This is a simple flask app that works as a webfrontend for a simple dynamic dns hosting service.

In the back, it uses nsupdate to speak to the configured dns master and manage dns records for the registered users.

Use pip to install the things mentioned in requirements.txt to get started.
A virtualenv will also come in handy.

This thing is just in a very early stage and i don't know how far it will go from here.
